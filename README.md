# README

I have added all the code here. I even used a requirments.txt which is in the github. The data files are not to avoid redundency. Please use your own data files and add proper pathnames when running. Thank you.

Add the corresponding (one) line under the ``[to fill]`` in ``def forward()`` of the class for ffnn.py and rnn.py

Feel free to modify other part of code, they are just for your reference.

One example on running the code:

**FFNN**

``python ffnn.py --hidden_dim 10 --epochs 1 ``
``--train_data ./training.json --val_data ./validation.json``


**RNN**

``python rnn.py --hidden_dim 32 --epochs 10 ``
``--train_data training.json --val_data validation.json``
